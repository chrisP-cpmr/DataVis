damage makes the fruit unmarketable. The placement of wrapped bananas on motorbikes and trucks
caused physical injuries which affected the fingers on the outer row of the hands. After ripening the
bruised area becomes hardened and creates avenues for entry of pathogens. Since bananas are climacteric,
injury to the fruit causes ethylene production, increases respiration and water loss thereby
shortening postharvest life. Additionally, decay caused by pathogenic agents' sets in at the point of
injury",,Rapid Assessment,Kitinoja and Cantwell (2010),http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/save-food/PDF/Kenya_Food_Loss_Studies.pdf,

404,Kenya,,1316,"Mangoes, guavas and mangosteens",2012,25.0,Whole supply chain,,"The vast majority of mango farmers interviewed (98%) sold all their produce to
middlemen/brokers at the farm-gate with only 2 percent selling some of the produce to markets
outside Embu district. Usually, no collective bargaining takes place on the price because each
farmer interacts individually with traders (brokers) and as a result, traders take advantage of
farmers by colluding to buy mangoes at prices lower than the prevailing market prices. This
exploitative tendency by buyers who offer very low prices was mentioned by 94 percent of farmers
as the major marketing challenge followed by delayed purchase after harvest (64%). This occurs
when brokers instruct farmers to harvest the mangoes promising to pick them up the next day but 
41
then intentionally delay to do so. They then persuade farmers to sell their produce at lower prices
to avoid additional spoilage and loss given that mangoes are highly perishable. On-farm sorting,
grading and bulking of mango fruit is a common practice and is usually done by traders (brokers)
before buying them. They bring their own workers to the farm to harvest the fruit or by giving a
purchasing future date thus advising farmers on when to harvest. In both cases, the buyer meets the
labour costs involved. After sorting, damaged mangoes are rejected by buyers and farmers usually
have to find alternative use or ways to dispose the fruits. Those rejected because of fruit fly
infestation are buried in a deep hole.
The lack of good storage facilities at the farm level was also a major challenge that compelled
54 percent of farmers to sell their mangoes on the day of harvesting. Others (46%) kept them under a
makeshift shed to minimize sunburn, loss of moisture and accumulation of dust for a few days as
they waited to sell. In addition, most access roads to farms are passable only during the dry seasons
of the year but if there are heavy rains during the harvesting period, accessibility is impeded thus
contributing to post-harvest losses and a deterioration of quality leading to low selling prices. When
farmers were asked to rank the attributes that buyers considered as the most important when
selecting mangoes for purchase, 96 percent ranked fruit size first, followed closely by quality (92%),
colour as a maturity indicator (80%) and mango variety (42%). These results reveal the importance
of quality as a key attribute of marketable fruit. It is a compound attribute that refers to the lack of
external or internal damage or injury caused by insect pests, diseases, birds or mechanical damage.",The model was estimated using data collected from 240 mango growing farmers selected using multistage and proportionate to size random sampling procedures.,Survey,MUCHIRI CAROLINE MUGURE; MSc Thesis_Caroline Muchiri.pdf,,"The clustered distribution of the economic loss indicates that 36 percent of mango
farmers suffered produce losses of less than 10 percent while 8 percent of farmers suffered losses
of more than 40 percent via rejections during harvest. From the study, the mean percentage fruit
loss was found to be 24 percent with some farmers experiencing losses of up to 60 percent. The
mean percentage loss for farmers who intercropped (24.4%) was not very different from that
suffered by those who monocropped (23.1%)"

done in room. During survey, no cold storage
facility was reported. The dealers in Krishi Bazar
store oranges in cemented floor on plastics, straw

time. Only storage for 2 to 4 days was observed.
During this time, losses upto 5% was reported by
dealers. This loss was due to evaporation loss,
rottening, breakage, etc.For the assessment of
post harvest storage losses in room condition,
oranges were evaluated according to the following
categories:
a. Oranges without shrinkage or diseases and
disorders.
b. Oranges without pathological diseases.
c. Oranges without disorders or evaporative loss.
In every case, losses were evaluated after having
divided oranges visually. The results obtained are
shown in the Figure 1. They represent the
